# Mission statement

## Why am I doing this?

I want to become a developer and leave my shitty IT job. I want to make things that are meaningful to the world and have utility. 

## What has caused me to fail in the past?

Procrastination, and a sense of unworthyness of my peers.

## Why overcome that

Because when it comes down to it I am not that stupid and I have been around computers my entire life. This is in my blood, I just need to take up the mantle.
